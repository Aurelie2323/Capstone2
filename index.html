      <p style="font-size: 17px;">Jenna Greene knew what it felt like to succumb to disordered eating after following what she thought were simple, healthy lifestyle hacks on YouTube. She started off by watching the popular genre of “what I eat in a day” videos and gradually escalated throughout her adolescence to thinking of ways she could gamify her diet and cut as many calories as possible from ‘bad’ foods. To her, food became something functional. Something that had to be nutritionally rich and free of all the excesses that come with modern processed foods. But above all, it had to make her skinny. She soon transitioned to using dieting apps and other means to shrink down her weight by carefully logging her food intake and exercise. Finally, after some years of deprogramming from her rigid relationship with food and her body– a process which involved her becoming a social worker and studying nutrition– Jenna now spends a good deal of her time treating patients with similar concerns. She still believes that it is difficult to get away from the shiny appeal of using the “scientifically proven” dieting and lifestyle apps that many of her patients with EDs have been using, especially when her younger clients are drawn in by their “anti-diet” appeal. Apps that have especially gained prominence in the past few years including Noom, PlateJoy, WW/ Weightwatchers. But now she says she will never turn up the joy of doing away with restrictive diets and relearning intuitive eating. A skill that she now passes on to her patients.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">It’s no secret that advertisers will always try to appeal to popular culture. It’s how they keep their business afloat, and the dieting industry is no exception to this. But what makes this current iteration of diet culture so unique is the way that it has co-opted the wellness and body positive values of Generation Z. Diet and weight loss apps like Noom claim to be anti-diet while still linking wellness to a number on the scale. Gen Z is currently the most diverse, educated and the largest age cohort of all. They are also the largest generation with the highest number of reports of mental health disturbances and the first to be continually exposed to a constant barrage of beauty standard marketing from their peers and advertisers online.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">“Unlearning so much of diet culture and how it's wrapped up in like ableism and capitalism and white supremacy and all of these things and how the weight loss industry is not sustainable for the vast majority of folks. It's a multibillion dollar industry that is harmful to so many people and it doesn't work anyway,” says Tara Criscuolo who is a Blog Manager, Volunteer and Eating Disorder Coach at Project HEAL, an organization that connects people struggling with eating disorders to healthcare resources and support.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">Diet culture has been around as long as humans ascribed meaning to foods and nutrition while wanting to control their appearances. The Japanese practice of “hara hachi bu” is believed to date back centuries ago from Okinawa, which focuses on mindful eating and stopping your intake at 80% fullness to obtain longevity and good health. In 1862, an English undertaker named William Banting published what is considered the first diet pamphlet, which advised a high-protein, high-fat and low-carb diet to shed pounds. By the 20th century, globalization led to the diversification of food around the world including fast food and highly processed foods. This led to a rise in global obesity rates and obesity related diseases. Health-conscious dietary trends grew in tandem with new diets that targeted weight loss. The post WW1 era saw the creation of Jenny Craig and Jean Nidetch founded Weight Watchers during a time when the popular consciousness in the USA saw a fit body as part of their civic duty. In the 70s, the first evidence of dietary fat being linked to heart disease led to a low-fat craze and the rise of “fat-free” foods such as turkey bacon and fat free milk. Harold Katz founded Nutrisystem in 1972 and introduced portion-controlled pre-packaged meals shipped to client’s doorsteps. That same year, Robert Atkins popularized the high-fat, low-carb Atkins diet, while conversely the low-fat diet popularized in 1977 by Senator George McGovern’s report on Ancel Keys’s nutrition studies – recommended a low-fat, high carb diet! By 2022 the diet industry was worth nearly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-weight-loss-industry-89419ecb">$75 billion dollars</a> with gym memberships, diet services and all. This large financial incentive drives the market where "lifestyle apps" like Noom thrive masquerading as wellness-oriented when essentially functioning as diet apps.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">When Tara’s mentee in eating disorder recovery tells her that she started using the online nutrition platform Noom to moderate her foods, Tara advised against it. Despite the platform advertising itself as an anti-diet diet, Tara now recognizes eating disorder triggers lurking within  diet plans.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">This is what happened to Shan M, a 25 year-old Miami University student who started using Noom to lose 12 pounds for her wedding photos. She did not have that foresight like Tara. “I joined the app [Noom] after the ad kept popping up on my Instagram feed and I figured I could use some help to get to my goal," she said.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">At 5 '6 and 148 lbs, Shan wanted to get back to her pre-pandemic weight when she first met her boyfriend, now fiancé. She paid for the regular 16 month plan but was shocked to discover that Noom had put her on a 1,260 calories-a-day diet, including daily exercise.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">“I remember thinking that's how much my little sister eats– who is 15.”</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">The program included daily mini psychology lessons that instructed on subjects like emotional eating or childhood ingrained eating habits. It also assigned her a coach that she could connect to every two weeks to keep her going, along with connecting her to a chatroom with other people using Noom. But the problem of Noom’s food recommendation system soon became clear.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">“They would give you this color system where you could log your food into green, yellow and red foods, with green being the advisable and red meaning stay away, which didn’t always make sense to me because certain foods like olive oil red and white wine green,” said Shan, because at the time before Noom <a href="https://www.noom.com/blog/safety-updates-2022/">discontinued coding foods</a> as Red in August 2023 in response to popular criticism.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">Noom is not the first diet to use a color system to categorize their food. The Atkins diet sells a three phase program corresponding to the “induction” where most carbs are removed, “balancing your diet” where minimal carbs are reintroduced, and the final “maintenance phase”. Since the Atkins diet is centered around carb reduction, their program has you count your carb intake for the day. “Whatever the color system [in Noom] it implies that there’s bad food,” says Tara. “There are foods that are more nutrient dense, but all foods fit in recovery and in a healthy life. And research shows that restriction is harmful and it leads to binging.” Color systems such as the one in Noom are a standard part of diet services.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">“I refuse to talk to people about weight loss,” says Dina D’Alessandro, a professor of nutrition at Lehman College who is a registered dietitian and runs a private practice called Dish With Dina. She instead focuses on people’s underlying habits. “Not every thin person is healthy and not every fat person is unhealthy.” Dina tells her patients and students that each person’s dietary needs will be different, especially when chronic and underlying conditions are present.</p>


      <p style="font-size: 17px;">While the color system is also meant to point your attention to the amount of water a food item has and therefore which ones you can consume more quantities of, Dina says that the color system teaches people to ignore highly nutritious foods like nuts and seeds in favor of quick and easy highly processed foods that may fall under Noom’s calorie budget.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">“It teaches people to honor low calorie, but low calories isn’t always the best option because then you’re hungry all the time,” she says. A more balanced meal alternative, according to Dina,  that Noom surely would have deemed in the “red zone” would be to pair a carb like an apple, and a protein like a piece of cheese or peanut butter. Proteins take around 9 hours to digest while carbs take around 2 hours.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">This language of wellness is being co-opted by advertisers as the result of shrewd marketing to appeal to Gen Z’s core values. As the largest generation in American history ranging from age eight to 23, gen Z is on track to be the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/#:~:text=One%2Din%2Dfour%20Gen%20Zers,Millennials%20at%20the%20same%20age.">most racially, ethnically diverse</a> and highly educated generation yet. When it comes to heath, Gen Z places a special emphasis on balancing both mental and physical wellness instead of just one’s physique, following in the wake of the Millennial’s generational emphasis on <a href="https://mspmag.com/health-and-fitness/going-natural-how-millennials-are-shaping-health-care/">seeking alternative medicine</a>. Gen Z is also the largest generation to have gone to therapy, with over 70% reporting to have attended some form of therapy. This emphasis on wellness and governmental and corporate good will is a key value of Gen Z that the diet industry has co-opted in order to gain the approval and spending of Gen Z dollars. Such is the case with Weight Watchers changing their brand name to “WW,” and switching their slogan to “wellness that works” in order to distance themselves from weight loss per se but to wellness.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">Nutritionist Dina from Dish With Dina believes Noom and other commodified diet packages prey on our culture’s individualistic culture that looks at weight and health as an individual's responsibility and shame, rather than helping us address systemic failures that lead to poor public health.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">Noom, Weight Watchers and other apps let users connect their fitbits and other health trackers to log each user’s physical activity and send incentives and rewards for movement. Instead, as Dina says, we should be addressing adding public spaces for people to exercise, improve access to healthcare and get our elected officials to provide fresh, affordable produce to our local delis and bodegas.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">Dieting apps like Noom push most of their advertising on social media, showing up on an Instagram scroll sessions or between YouTube clips with with tantalizing messages like “stop dieting now, get long term results” or with one video of a woman running that states “here’s why you’re not losing weight even though you’re working out.” This kind of messaging does not come in a vacuum, but exists among an online ecosystem that is rife with “fitstagram” and “fit-fluencer culture,” and with many of these “fit-fluencers” being paid and sponsored by sports apparel or diet companies.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">In her <a href="https://digitalcommons.csumb.edu/caps_thes_all/138/">capstone</a> examining the impact of fitness culture and social media on American youths and their body image, California State University graduate Mackenzie Norton found that “fitspiration” culture is as present as ever. Diet culture is almost impossible to escape if you’re online. America’s long tradition of fitness marketing in America since the 70s capitalizes on selling an idealized aesthetic for each gender. Norton conducted a survey on 188 participants asking them whether they compare their bodies to others on social media, whether they feel bad about themselves after consuming fitness content online, and whether they are more likely to compare themselves to online fitness influencers and athletes over supermodels and celebrities. Overall, she found that most participants reported experiencing a worse body image after consuming fitness content online across both genders, but the respondents who identified as women tended to compare themselves mostly to celebrities and supermodels online while those who identified as men were more likely to compare themselves to athletes and fitness influencers.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">As she puts it in her capstone, “the media portrayed a fit physique not only as a standard, but as a product of ‘social responsibility and civic action '”. Norton ties together how advertising gives customers a sense of “right” like eating healthy foods, and “wrong” like skipping a workout. This way, people are led to self-regulate in order to avoid becoming an outsider and equated as morally inferior. Fitness influencers and other people online with the physique that matches the pushed ideal are affirmed by receiving brand sponsorship for products like sportswear or makeup, and receive social acceptance by racking up a large follower count. This, as argued by Norton, reinforces the cycle of ‘lifestyle gurus’ on social media, perpetuating unrealistic body aesthetics while emphasizing health as an individual’s responsibility rather than a public health concern. The addition of technologies like smart watches and FitBits make it even easier to monitor your fitness and diet throughout the day, making it simpler to fall into a rigid relationship with your nutrition.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">Jacqueline Santos became attracted to my Fitness Pal’s paid subscription promise of helping her achieve a healthier lifestyle after a childhood of processed foods. She was raised by a single mother of four who worked a part-time job and didn’t have the time to plan every meal. “She did the best she could and I understand. But now that I’m older, I want to learn more about nutrition and feed myself better,” says Santos, 31, a server from Brooklyn.</p>
    
      <p style="font-size: 17px;">She joined a gym in 2021 and started powerlifting a year later after meeting someone at the gym who introduced her to the sport. Soon after getting involved in the fitness community, Santos registered for Noom in order to maximize her results at the gym and achieve the “fitness body” that other powerlifters she followed had online. Knowing that Noom gives you the option to log your physical activity by connecting tracking Fitbit watches to the app, Santos began tracing what she felt was an unhealthy obsession with fat loss.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">She began reducing her caloric intake and exercising less frequently as she noticed her body becoming fatigued more quickly. It wasn’t until a month into her 1,350 calorie-a-day diet that she realized she had been spending more energy focusing on looking fit than being fit, and becoming increasingly stressed and restricted. She said that she lost the feeling of empowerment that drove her to fitness in the first place.</p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 17px;">“That’s when I knew,” said Santos once she realized that she no longer experienced the same feelings of healthiness and empowerment she once felt when she started powerlifting. After deleted Noom, she resumed her old approach to nutrition by tuning into her body listening to her hunger and satiety signals. Instead of restricting and counting her calories, Santos tried to incorporate more whole foods and more variety within her budget.</p>

      <p style="font-size: 17px;">Without the stress of calorie counting and the fatigue brought on by constant hunger, Santos regained her enthusiasm and her strength while powerlifting. She now measures her health by how strong she feels rather than how small the number on the scale is.</p>
